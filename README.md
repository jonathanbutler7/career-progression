# Career progression plan

The point of this document is to outline a path of learning that will allow me to increase my value to Weave. I conceived it in part due to lack of clarity surrounding what is required for a FE engineer to get promoted. Justin understood that process far better than I do, and since he's leaving I wrote out this plan to get his feedback before he leaves. Now that I've received his feedback, this is a living document to outline my plan for increasing my skillset, and therefore my value to Weave.

### The success of this plan will be gauged by

1. Salary increase in December
2. Promotion to next engineering level
3. How much weight is given to my opinion by my peers (too subjective?)

### Ratings

- Significant gaps in performance
- Gaps in performances
- Successful performances
- Extraordinary performance
- Redefines performance

# Review period 1: May - Dec 2021

### Goals for Review Period 1:

- `Extraordinary performance` in every category
  - Need more details on what the categories are
- Promotion to next level 
  - how can ensure my skills can be put to use as I am learning them and leveling them up?
- 12% raise
  - this number feels private/personal, I'm open for discussion on whether this is reasonable

## **Tech Focuses** (things I don't deeply understand but want to level up):

- Github actions
- Deployment/build processes
- Spend education budget
  - Pluralsight?
  - [Frontend masters monorepos](https://frontendmasters.com/courses/monorepos/)
  - [Frontend masters CSS](https://frontendmasters.com/courses/css-in-depth-v2/)
- React query (caching)
- `design-system`
  - documentation website
  - monorepo/subpackages
  - npm setup
- [Algorithms/data structures (interview practice)](https://www.educative.io/courses/grokking-the-coding-interview?ref=hackernoon.com&source=post_page)
  - I don't like cramming algorithms, so the point of this is to stay 'in shape' and learn slowly over time
- Extracurricular project(?)
  - Audio processing program (C or C++)

## **Soft Skill Focuses**

- Build trust with FE team (not just FEDOPS)
- Answer people's questions meaningfully
- Clearly communicate tradeoffs between technologies
- Gain better understanding/context of Weave products from a business perspective
- Develop an internal dialogue in meetings so I can ask good questions
